This is a simple webapp created using Claude Code only. I did not write a line of code. 

This web app uses React for the front end, and Spring Boot for the backend. 

The application currently has 2 function: 
* It will extract text from various document types (doc, pdf, html, etc)
* It will create thumbnails for images and PDFs.
